  description: |
    Dearly is a private family-sharing app that bridges generational gaps and makes staying connected easier and more meaningful. The platform allows families to share photos, voice memos, and other media in a secure, invite-only space. With two thoughtfully designed modes, Dearly caters to every generation: a streamlined, user-friendly interface for those less familiar with technology and a dynamic, feature-rich experience for younger users.
